# High School Java Assignments

Assignments made with Processing and Eclipse IDE's for two Java courses I took in high school in the year 2009. Mr. Simon taught the courses.

## Getting Started

The processing folder contains the Processing (.pde) programs.
The eclipse folder contains the Java (.java) programs to run with Processing.

Compile the .pde files with a Processing compiler. Processing JS recommended.
Compile the .java files with a Java compiler. Eclipse+Processing recommended.

* **Battleship** - The classic game of battleship, simplified.
* **Circular Motion** - Spheres orbiting like planets in space.
* **Color Mixer** - Mix colors in a cool UI.
* **Dice** - Roll dice in Processing.
* **Twenty One Dice** - Roll 21 dice at a time.
* **Fractal Tree** - A tree with recursive branches.
* **Lunar Lander** - Land a lunar module on the moon.
* **Minesweeper** - The classic Minesweeper game.
* **MP3 Visualizer** - Visualize a royalty free reggae song.
* **Olympic Rings** - Olympic rings rendered in Processing.

* **Chemotaxis** - Cells in a petri dish moving about.
* **Slot Machine** - Play the slots!
* **Star Field** - Beginnings of a star field used in the Asteroids game.
* **Crazy Dot** - Beginnings of the vehicle used in the Asteroids game.
* **Asteroids Part 1** - Part 1 of the classic Atari Asteroids game.
* **Asteroids Part 2** - Part 2 of the classic Atari Asteroids game.
* **Asteroids Part 3** - Part 3 of the classic Atari Asteroids game.
* **Asteroids Part 4** - Part 4 of the classic Atari Asteroids game.

### Prerequisites

* [Processing](https://processing.org/download/) - Processing IDE
* [Eclipse + Processing](https://processing.org/tutorials/eclipse/) - Use Processing in Eclipse.

### Installing

Processing programs run from the Processing IDE.
Eclipse programs need to be compiled first into JAR files, then they can be executed on HTML files using Processing libraries.

## Built With

* [Processing](https://processing.org/) - The IDE and compiler used for .pde programs.
* [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) - The IDE and compiler used for .java programs.
* [Eclipse + Processing](https://processing.org/tutorials/eclipse/) - Use Processing in Eclipse.
